📌 Introduction
This project builds a Book Recommendation System using machine learning to suggest books based on various criteria such as:
✔ User interests
✔ Preferred authors
✔ Content similarity
✔ Writing style & themes
The model helps readers discover new books tailored to their preferences! 📖✨

📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Goodreads, containing information like:
Title
Author
Genres
User Ratings
Reviews
Description

The data is preprocessed to extract meaningful insights for recommendations.
🚀 Features
✅ Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on description similarity using NLP (TF-IDF).
✅ Collaborative Filtering: Uses user ratings to recommend books similar to those liked by others.
✅ Hybrid Model: Combines content & collaborative filtering for better recommendations.
✅ Interactive Interface: Deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

📌 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning – Removing null values, handling duplicates, preprocessing text.
2️⃣ Feature Engineering – Using TF-IDF,standard Scalar,One-Hot encoding for content similarity.
3️⃣ Model Selection – Implementing Content-Based & Collaborative Filtering.
4️⃣ Recommendation System Development – Generating book suggestions based on user input.
5️⃣ Web App Deployment – Using Streamlit for an interactive UI.

🧠 Modeling
Used TF-IDF Vectorization for content similarity.
Implemented Cosine Similarity for text-based recommendations.
Tried SVD & Matrix Factorization for collaborative filtering.
Combined methods for recommendations.

📈 Results
✅ The recommendation system suggests highly relevant books based on input queries.
✅ Successfully deployed as a Streamlit web app.

🔮 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve recommendations using Deep Learning (BERT, Transformers)
🔹 Include User-Based Collaborative Filtering
🔹 Deploy on AWS / Google Cloud for better scalability
